    "## Do the following to set up an HBase cluster:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** we want you to use a small but real cluster for running HBase rather than a single machine. But, these clusters burn Azure credit very quickly&mdash;the cheapest configuration consumes roughly **2 CHF per hour**, which is a lot relative to your overall credit&mdash;so it is very important for you to **delete your cluster once you are done.** Luckily, it is possible to keep your data intact when you delete a cluster, and see it again when you recreate it; we will touch upon this in the process. Now, let's start. Those steps are very similar to the HDFS cluster we create on week 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Azure portal click the **\"Create a resource\"** button on the left, type **\"hdinsight\"** in the search box, and select **\"Azure HDInsight\"** and click **\"Create\"**. HDInsight is Microsoft's cloud service which wraps Hadoop, HBase, Spark and other Big Data technologies; read more [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/).\n",

    "<img src=\"https://bigdataforeng2020.blob.core.windows.net/exercise05/HBase_2_Subscription_Resource_Group.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Name your HBase cluster and select the region to be **\"(Europe) West Europe\"**. Choose **\"HBase\"** for cluster type and use **version 1.1.2**. Then setup the cluster login username and password, as well as the SSH username.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://bigdataforeng2020.blob.core.windows.net/exercise05/HBase_4_Username.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Next, we need to configure the **\"Storage\"** tab. The canonical way would be to use an HDFS cluster as a storage layer for an HBase cluster, but we will be using the Blob service of Windows Azure Storage for this purpose. This has a significant advantage of allowing you to delete your HBase cluster without losing the data: you can recreate the cluster using the same Azure Storage Account and the same container and you will see the same data. This is useful, for example, if you don't have time to finish this exercise in one sitting: you can just delete your cluster, recreate it later, and continue your work. Azure storage is selected by default (see the screenshot).  \n",
    "To setup your HBase cluster for the first time, in **\"Primary storage account\"** click **\"Create new\"** and specify a name. Leave everything else as it is and click \"Next\".\n",
    "<img src=\"https://bigdataforeng2020.blob.core.windows.net/exercise05/HBase_5_Storage.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "**Important**: if you are recreating your HBase cluster and want to see the existing data, then choose **\"Select existing\"** and set the container name to the one that you used last time&mdash;by default Azure generates a new container name every time you create a cluster, which then points to a different container. The container name can be found in \"Storage account - containers\".\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In the \"Security + networking\" tab do not choose anything, just click \"Next: Configuration + pricing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now we need to choose the configuration of the nodes in our HBase cluster. It will be enough to have **only 2 RegionServers** (see the screenshot). As for the node size, let us be wise and select the economical option: click on \"Region node size\" and choose **\"D3 V2\"**; do the same for the Head nodes; the \"Zookeeper\" nodes should have **\"A4 v2\"** selected by default (Zookeeper is a [distributed coordination service](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) used by HBase). Click **\"Review + create\"**.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://bigdataforeng2020.blob.core.windows.net/exercise05/HBase_6_Node_size.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the last step, \"Summary\", check if the settings are as you intend. These clusters are expensive, so it is worth checking the price estimate at this step: for me it is 1.90 CHF/hour; if your price is larger than this, check your node sizes and counts. When done, initiate the cluster creation by clicking \"Create\". The process will take time, around 15&mdash;25 minutes."
